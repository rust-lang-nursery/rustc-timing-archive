    std: Change String::truncate to panic less
    
    The `Vec::truncate` method does not panic if the length argument is greater than
    the vector's current length, but `String::truncate` will indeed panic. This
    semantic difference can be a bit jarring (e.g. #32717), and after some
    discussion the libs team concluded that although this can technically be a
    breaking change it is almost undoubtedly not so in practice.
    
    This commit changes the semantics of `String::truncate` to be a noop if
    `new_len` is greater than the length of the current string.
    
    Closes #32717
