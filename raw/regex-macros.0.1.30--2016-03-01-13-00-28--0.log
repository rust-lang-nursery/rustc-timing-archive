    Auto merge of #31939 - killercup:patch-17, r=brson
    
    Use unordered nested list for stabilised APIs to improve readability. This makes the release notes for 1.7 a bit longer, but I don't think we should optimise for brevity here. It's a bit inconsistent since the other releases are not done this way, so feel free to ignore this change.
    
    Also:
    - Add link to `u32::checked_neg`
    - Remove trailing back tick from BTreeMap line
