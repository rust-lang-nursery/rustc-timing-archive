    rustbuild: Fix dist for non-host targets
    
    The `rust-std` package that we produce is expected to have not only the standard
    library but also libtest for compiling unit tests. Unfortunately this does not
    currently happen due to the way rustbuild is structured.
    
    There are currently two main stages of compilation in rustbuild, one for the
    standard library and one for the compiler. This is primarily done to allow us to
    fill in the sysroot right after the standard library has finished compiling to
    continue compiling the rest of the crates. Consequently the entire compiler does
    not have to explicitly depend on the standard library, and this also should
    allow us to pull in crates.io dependencies into the build in the future because
    they'll just naturally build against the std we just produced.
    
    These phases, however, do not represent a cross-compiled build. Target-only
    builds also require libtest, and libtest is currently part of the
    all-encompassing "compiler build". There's unfortunately no way to learn about
    just libtest and its dependencies (in a great and robust fashion) so to ensure
    that we can copy the right artifacts over this commit introduces a new build
    step, libtest.
    
    The new libtest build step has documentation, dist, and link steps as std/rustc
    already do. The compiler now depends on libtest instead of libstd, and all
    compiler crates can now assume that test and its dependencies are implicitly
    part of the sysroot (hence explicit dependencies being removed). This makes the
    build a tad less parallel as in theory many rustc crates can be compiled in
    parallel with libtest, but this likely isn't where we really need parallelism
    either (all the time is still spent in the compiler).
    
    All in all this allows the `dist-std` step to depend on both libstd and libtest,
    so `rust-std` packages produced by rustbuild should start having both the
    standard library and libtest.
    
    Closes #32523
