    Fix wrong statement in compare_exchange doc
    
    The documentation for `core::sync::atomic::AtomicSomething::compare_exchange` contains a wrong, or imprecise, statement about the return value. It goes:
    
    The return value is a result indicating whether the new value was written and containing
    the previous value. On success this value is guaranteed to be equal to `new`.
    
    In the second sentence, `this value` is gramatically understood as referring to `return value` from the first sentence. Due to how CAS works, the returned value is always what was in the atomic variable _before_ the operation occurred, not what was written into it during the operation. Hence, the fixed doc should say:
    
    The return value is a result indicating whether the new value was written and containing
    the previous value. On success this value is guaranteed to be equal to `current`.
    
    This version is confirmed by the runnable examples in variants of `AtomicSomething`, e.g.
    
        assert_eq!(some_bool.compare_exchange(true, false, Ordering::Acquire, Ordering::Relaxed),
        Ok(true));
    
    where the returned value is `Ok(current)`. This PR fixes all occurrences of this bug I could find.
    
    An alternative solution would be to modify the second sentence so that it refers to the value _written_ into the Atomic rather than what was there before, in which case it would be correct. Example alternative formulation:
    
    On success the value written into the `bool`/`usize`/`whatever` is guaranteed to be equal to `new`.
