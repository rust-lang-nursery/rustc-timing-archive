    Auto merge of #33099 - eddyb:issue-33096, r=michaelwoerister
    
    Normalize types before using them in debuginfo.
    
    Small oversight, fixes #33096 - odd thing is that the old code doesn't look like it should've ever worked, although it wasn't using all of the type parameters, so maybe that's what changed.
