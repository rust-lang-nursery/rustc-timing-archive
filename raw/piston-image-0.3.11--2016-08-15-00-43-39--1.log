    Auto merge of #35427 - cardoe:arm-musl-targets, r=alexcrichton
    
    add GNU make files for arm-unknown-linux-musleabi
    
    For Yocto (Embedded Linux meta distro) Rust is provided via the [meta-rust layer](https://github.com/meta-rust/meta-rust). In this project there have been patches to add `arm-unknown-linux-musleabi`. Rust recently acquired that support via #35060 but only for rustbuild. meta-rust is currently only able to build Rust support with the existing GNU Makefiles. This adds `arm-unknown-linux-musleabi` support to Rust for the GNU Makefiles until meta-rust is able to sort out why using rustbuild does not work for it.
