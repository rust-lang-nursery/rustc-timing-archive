    Auto merge of #32695 - sfackler:default-buf-size, r=alexcrichton
    
    Drop the default buffer size to 8K
    
    The 64k capacity was picked by me a couple of years ago in the initial
    implementation of buffered IO adaptors:
    https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/9091/files#diff-b131eeef531ad098b32f49695a031008R62.
    64K was picked for symmetry with libuv, which we no longer use.
    
    64K is *way* larger than the default size of any other language that I
    can find. C, C++, and Java default to 8K, and Go defaults to 4K. There
    have been a variety of issues filed relating to this such as #31885.
    
    Closes #31885
