    Auto merge of #37129 - arielb1:erased-normal, r=eddyb
    
    normalize types every time HR regions are erased
    
    Associated type normalization is inhibited by higher-ranked regions.
    Therefore, every time we erase them, we must re-normalize.
    
    I was meaning to introduce this change some time ago, but we used
    to erase regions in generic context, which broke this terribly (because
    you can't always normalize in a generic context). That seems to be gone
    now.
    
    Ensure this by having a `erase_late_bound_regions_and_normalize`
    function.
    
    Fixes #37109 (the missing call was in mir::block).
