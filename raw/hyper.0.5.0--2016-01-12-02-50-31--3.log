    Auto merge of #30678 - Amanieu:no_elf_tls, r=alexcrichton
    
    I also re-enabled the use of `#[thread_local]` on AArch64. It was originally disabled in the PR that introduced AArch64 (#19790), but the reasons for this were not explained. `#[thread_local]` seems to work fine in my tests on AArch64, so I don't think this should be an issue.
