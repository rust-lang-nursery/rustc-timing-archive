    Implement RFC 1560 behind `#![feature(item_like_imports)]`
    
    This implements https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1560 (cc #35120) behind the `item_like_imports` feature gate.
    
    The [RFC text](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1560-name-resolution.md#changes-to-name-resolution-rules) describes the changes to name resolution enabled by `#![feature(item_like_imports)` in detail. To summarize,
     - Items and named imports shadow glob imports.
     - Multiple globs can import the same name if the name is unused or the imports are shadowed.
     - Multiple globs can import the same name if the imports are of the same item (following re-exports).
      - The visibility of such a name is the maximum visibility of the imports.
      - Equivalently, adding a glob import will never reduce the visibility of a name, nor will removing one increase it.
     - Non-prelude private imports can be used wherever we currently allow private items to be used.
      - Prelude-imported names are unaffected, i.e. they continue to be usable only in lexical scopes.
     - Globs import all visible names, not just public names.
      - Equivalently, glob importing from an ancestor module imports all of the ancestor's names, and glob importing from other modules is unchanged.
