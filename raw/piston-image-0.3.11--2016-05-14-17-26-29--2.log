    Make AtomicBool the same size as bool
    
    Reopening #32365
    
    This allows `AtomicBool` to be transmuted to a `bool`, which makes it more consistent with the other atomic types. Note that this now guarantees that the atomic type will always contain a valid `bool` value, which wasn't the case before (due to `fetch_nand`).
