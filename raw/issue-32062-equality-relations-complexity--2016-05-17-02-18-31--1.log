commit 786b26d7b48accffc638f8c2767a6e4a6f1991a5

    Auto merge of #33491 - arielb1:obligation-jungle, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Replace the obligation forest with a graph
    
    In the presence of caching, arbitrary nodes in the obligation forest can be merged, which makes it a general graph. Handle it as such, using cycle-detection algorithms in the processing.
    
    I should do performance measurements sometime.
    
    This was pretty much written as a proof-of-concept. Please help me write this in a less-ugly way. I should also add comments explaining what is going on.
