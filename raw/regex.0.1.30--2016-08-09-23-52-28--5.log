    Auto merge of #35401 - jonathandturner:enable_json_and_new_errors, r=jonathandturner
    
    Turn on new errors and json mode
    
    This PR is a big-switch, but on a well-worn path:
    
    * Turns on new errors by default (and removes old skool)
    * Moves json output from behind a flag
    
    The RFC for new errors [landed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1644) and as part of that we wanted some bake time.  It's now had a few weeks + all the time leading up to the RFC of people banging on it.  We've also had [editors updating to the new format](https://github.com/saviorisdead/RustyCode/pull/159) and expect more to follow.
    
    We also have an [issue on old skool](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35330) that needs to be fixed as more errors are switched to the new style, but it seems silly to fix old skool errors when we fully intend to throw the switch in the near future.
    
    This makes it lean towards "why not just throw the switch now, rather than waiting a couple more weeks?"  I only know of vim that wanted to try to parse the new format but were not sure how, and I think we can reach out to them and work out something in the 8 weeks before this would appear in a stable release.
    
    We've [hashed out](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35330) stabilizing JSON output, and it seems like people are relatively happy making what we have v1 and then likely adding to it in the future.  The idea is that we'd maintain backward compatibility and just add new fields as needed.  We'll also work on a separate output format that'd be better suited for interactive tools like IDES (since JSON message can get a little long depending on the error).
    
    This PR stabilizes JSON mode, allowing its use without `-Z unstable-options`
    
    Combined, this gives editors two ways to support errors going forward: parsing the new error format or using the JSON mode.  By moving JSON to stable, we can also add support to Cargo, which plugin authors tell us does help simplify their support story.
