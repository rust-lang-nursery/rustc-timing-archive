    Auto merge of #32293 - nikomatsakis:incr-comp-def-path-munging, r=alexcrichton
    
    Revamp symbol names for impls (and make them deterministic, etc)
    
    This builds on @michaelwoerister's epic PR #31539 (note that his PR never landed, so I just incorporated it into this one). The main change here is that we remove the "name" from `DefPathData` for impls, since that name is synthetic and not sufficiently predictable for incr comp. However, just doing that would cause bad symbol names since those are based on the `DefPath`. Therefore, I introduce a new mechanism for getting symbol names (and also paths for user display) called `item_path`. This is kind of simplistic for now (based on strings) but I expect to expand it later to support richer types, hopefully generating C++-mangled names that gdb etc can understand. Along the way I cleaned up how we track the path that leads to an extern crate.
    
    There is still some cleanup left undone here. Notably, I didn't remove the impl names altogether -- that would probably make sense. I also didn't try to remove the `item_symbols` vector. Mostly I want to unblock my other incr. comp. work. =)
