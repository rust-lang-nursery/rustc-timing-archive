    Auto merge of #30595 - steveklabnik:remove_learn_rust, r=gankro
    
    Some history:
    
    While getting Rust to 1.0, it was a struggle to keep the book in a
    working state. I had always wanted a certain kind of TOC, but couldn't
    quite get it there.
    
    At the 11th hour, I wrote up "Rust inside other langauges" and "Dining
    Philosophers" in an attempt to get the book in the direction I wanted to
    go. They were fine, but not my best work. I wanted to further expand
    this section, but it's just never going to end up happening. We're doing
    the second draft of the book now, and these sections are basically gone
    already.
    
    Here's the issues with these two sections, and removing them just fixes
    it all:
    
    // Philosophers
    
    There was always controversy over which ones were chosen, and why. This
    is kind of a perpetual bikeshed, but it comes up every once in a while.
    
    The implementation was originally supposed to show off channels, but
    never did, due to time constraints. Months later, I still haven't
    re-written it to use them.
    
    People get different results and assume that means they're wrong, rather
    than the non-determinism inherent in concurrency. Platform differences
    aggrivate this, as does the exact amount of sleeping and printing.
    
    // Rust Inside Other Languages
    
    This section is wonderful, and shows off a strength of Rust. However,
    it's not clear what qualifies a language to be in this section. And I'm
    not sure how tracking a ton of other languages is gonna work, into the
    future; we can't test _anything_ in this section, so it's prone to
    bitrot.
    
    By removing this section, and making the Guessing Game an initial
    tutorial, we will move this version of the book closer to the future
    version, and just eliminate all of these questions.
    
    In addition, this also solves the 'split-brained'-ness of having two
    paths, which has endlessly confused people in the past.
    
    I'm sad to see these sections go, but I think it's for the best.
    
    Fixes #30471
    Fixes #30163
    Fixes #30162
    Fixes #25488
    Fixes #30345
    Fixes #29590
    Fixes #28713
    Fixes #28915
    
    And probably others. This lengthy list alone is enough to show that
    these should have been removed.
    
    RIP.
