    Auto merge of #35405 - futile:tests_warn_timeout, r=brson
    
    Add warning timeout for tests that run >1min
    
    This makes it easier to identify hanging tests. As described in #2873,
    when a test doesn't finish, we so far had no information on which test
    that was. In this PR, we add a duration of 60 seconds for each test,
    after which a warning will be printed mentioning that this specific test
    has been running for a long time already.
    
    Example output:
