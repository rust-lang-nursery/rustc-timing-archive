    Mention the crate type cdylib in rustc's usage
    
    Hello,
    
    I just tried to build a `cdylib` with the latest stable release, I've been passively waiting for this for quite some time now. Tested successfully on my machine, although it doesn't appear in `rustc`'s usage it seems to work like a charm so far. :grinning:
    
    Thanks!
