    Auto merge of #36766 - nnethercote:hash-span-capacity, r=bluss
    
    Clarify HashMap's capacity handling.
    
    HashMap has two notions of "capacity":
    
    - "Usable capacity": the number of elements a hash map can hold without
      resizing. This is the meaning of "capacity" used in HashMap's API,
      e.g. the `with_capacity()` function.
    
    - "Internal capacity": the number of allocated slots. Except for the
      zero case, it is always larger than the usable capacity (because some
      slots must be left empty) and is always a power of two.
    
    HashMap's code is confusing because it does a poor job of
    distinguishing these two meanings. I propose using two different terms
    for these two concepts. Because "capacity" is already used in HashMap's
    API to mean "usable capacity", I will use a different word for "internal
    capacity". I propose "span", though I'm happy to consider other names.
