    test: Move run-make tests into compiletest
    
    Forcing them to be embedded in makefiles precludes being able to run them in
    rustbuild, and adding them to compiletest gives us a great way to leverage
    future enhancements to our "all encompassing test suite runner" as well as just
    moving more things into Rust.
    
    All tests are still Makefile-based in the sense that they rely on `make` being
    available to run them, but there's no longer any Makefile-trickery to run them
    and rustbuild can now run them out of the box as well.
