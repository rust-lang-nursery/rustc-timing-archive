    Auto merge of #35261 - eddyb:llvm-autoupgrade, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Support removed LLVM intrinsics by invoking its AutoUpgrade mechanism.
    
    Turns out that LLVM sometimes renames platform intrinsics or replaces them with first-class instructions.
    For example, signed minimum became `select (icmp SLT, a, b), a, b` where `a` and `b` are vectors.
    
    This is blocking the Servo rustup ([relevant failure](http://build.servo.org/builders/windows-dev/builds/226/steps/compile/logs/stdio)), as they're using a few such intrinsics.
    The fix in this PR is to invoke LLVM's own `AutoUpgrade` mechanism to do the replacements.
