    Auto merge of #33124 - sfackler:kill-ipv6-only, r=alexcrichton
    
    Remove IPV6_V6ONLY functionality
    
    These settings can only be adjusted before bind time, which doesn't make
    sense in the current set of functionality. These methods are stable, but
    haven't hit a stable release yet.
    
    Closes #33052
    
    [breaking-change]
    
    r? @alexcrichton
    
    Will also need a backport to the beta.
