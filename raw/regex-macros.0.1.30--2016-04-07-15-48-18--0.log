    Save/load incremental compilation dep graph
    
    Contains the code to serialize/deserialize the dep graph to disk between executions. We also hash the item contents and compare to the new hashes. Also includes a unit test harness. There are definitely some known limitations, such as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32014 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32015, but I am leaving those for follow-up work.
    
    Note that this PR builds on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32007, so the overlapping commits can be excluded from review.
