    rustbuild: Document many more parts of the build
    
    This commit expands the bootstrap build system's `README.md` as well as ensuring
    that all API documentation is present and up-to-date. Additionally a new
    `config.toml.example` file is checked in with commented out versions of all
    possible configuration values.
