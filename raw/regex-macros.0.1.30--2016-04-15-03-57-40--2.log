    Auto merge of #32693 - kamalmarhubi:binary_search_by_key, r=alexcrichton
    
    collections: Add slice::binary_search_by_key
    
    This method adds to the family of `_by_key` methods, and is the
    counterpart of `slice::sort_by_key`. It was mentioned on #30423 but
    was not implemented at that time.
