    rustdoc: Don't generate empty files for stripped items
    
    We need to traverse stripped modules to generate redirect pages, but we shouldn't generate
    anything else for them.
    
    This now renders the file contents to a Vec before writing it to a file in one go. I think
    that's probably a better strategy anyway.
    
    Fixes: #34025
