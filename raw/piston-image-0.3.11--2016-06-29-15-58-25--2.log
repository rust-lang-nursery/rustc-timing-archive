    configure: Fix cross-compiling LLVM for realz
    
    Actually got it working this time, and it was again just a problem specifying
    the llvm-tblgen binary. We need to point it at the $CFG_BUILD target's tblgen
    and then we also needed to correct the path a bit.
rustc: ./piston-image-0.3.11
cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes -Zinput-stats
   Compiling png v0.3.1
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
