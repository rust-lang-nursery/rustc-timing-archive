    Auto merge of #31263 - dhuseby:fixing_bsd_builds, r=alexcrichton
    
    Something went haywire with github last night and the old PR https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31230 got closed somehow.  This new PR is to replace the old one.  This incorporates all of the feedback from the other PR.
    
    @alexcrichton I incorporated the suggestion from @semarie and the result is cleaner and clearer.  I think this is ready to go.
