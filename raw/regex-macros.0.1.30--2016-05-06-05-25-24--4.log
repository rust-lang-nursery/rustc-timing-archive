    Auto merge of #33086 - cardoe:non-blocking-rand-read, r=alexcrichton
    
    rand: don't block before random pool is initialized
    
    If we attempt a read with getrandom() on Linux the syscall can block
    before the random pool is initialized unless the GRND_NONBLOCK flag is
    passed. This flag causes getrandom() to instead return EAGAIN while the
    pool is uninitialized. To avoid downstream users of crate or std
    functionality that have no ability to avoid this blocking behavior this
    change causes Rust to read bytes from /dev/urandom while getrandom()
    would block and once getrandom() is available to use that. Fixes #32953.
