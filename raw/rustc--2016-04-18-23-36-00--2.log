    rustbuild: Add support for compiletest test suites
    
    This commit adds support in rustbuild for running all of the compiletest test
    suites as part of `make check`. The `compiletest` program was moved to
    `src/tools` (like `rustbook` and others) and is now just compiled like any other
    old tool. Each test suite has a pretty standard set of dependencies and just
    tweaks various parameters to the final compiletest executable.
    
    Note that full support is lacking in terms of:
    
    * Once a test suite has passed, that's not remembered. When a test suite is
      requested to be run, it's always run.
    * The arguments to compiletest probably don't work for every possible
      combination of platforms and testing environments just yet. There will likely
      need to be future updates to tweak various pieces here and there.
    * Cross compiled test suites probably don't work just yet, support for that will
      come in a follow-up patch.

cfg: host for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is x86_64
cfg: os for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: have good valgrind for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: using CC=gcc (CFG_CC)
cfg: disabling valgrind run-pass tests
