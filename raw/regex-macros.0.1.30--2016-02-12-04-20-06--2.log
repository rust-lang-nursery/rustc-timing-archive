    Auto merge of #31368 - JohanLorenzo:dont-strip-if-test-build, r=alexcrichton
    
    Tools which rely on DWARF for generating code coverage report, don't generate accurate numbers on test builds. For instance, [this sample main](https://github.com/JohanLorenzo/rust-testing-example/blob/757bdbf3887f43db9771c20cb72dfc32aa8f4321/src/main.rs) returns [100% coverage](https://coveralls.io/builds/4940156/source?filename=main.rs) when [kcov](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov/) runs.
    
    With @pnkfelix 's great help, we could narrow down the issue: The linker strips unused function during phase 6. Here's a patch which stops stripping when someone calls `rustc --test $ARGS`. @pnkfelix wasn't sure if we should add a new flag, or just use --test. What do you think @alexcrichton ?
    
    Also, I'm not too sure: where is the best place to add a test for this addition?
    
    Thanks for the help!
