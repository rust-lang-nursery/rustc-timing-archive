    Auto merge of #33478 - xen0n:normalize-callee-trait-ref, r=eddyb
    
    trans: callee: normalize trait_ref before use
    
    This fixes #33436 and #33461. Ran the tests and nothing else seems to be affected.
    
    P.S. How to write the regression test for this fix? Does this qualify as run-pass or run-make, as the test only needs to be successfully compiled to be considered passed? Will add the testcase (the minimal example in #33461 seems fit) after clarifying this.
