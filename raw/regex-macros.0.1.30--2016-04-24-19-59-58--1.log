    Auto merge of #33085 - fitzgen:make-enumerate-example-more-clear, r=steveklabnik
    
    Make the `Iterator::enumerate` doc example more clear
    
    The example uses integers for the value being iterated over, but the indices
    added by `enumerate` are also integers, so I always end up double taking and
    thinking harder than I should when parsing the documentation. I also always
    forget which order the index and value are in the tuple so I frequently hit this
    stumbling block. This commit changes the documentation to iterate over
    characters so that it is immediately obvious which part of the tuple is the
    index and which is the value.
