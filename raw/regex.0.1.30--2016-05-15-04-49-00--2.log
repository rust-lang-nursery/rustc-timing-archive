    Improve derived implementations for enums with lots of fieldless variants
    
    A number of trait methods like PartialEq::eq or Hash::hash don't
    actually need a distinct arm for each variant, because the code within
    the arm only depends on the number and types of the fields in the
    variants. We can easily exploit this fact to create less and better
    code for enums with multiple variants that have no fields at all, the
    extreme case being C-like enums.
    
    For nickel.rs and its by now infamous 800 variant enum, this reduces
    optimized compile times by 25% and non-optimized compile times by 40%.
    Also peak memory usage is down by almost 40% (310MB down to 190MB).
    
    To be fair, most other crates don't benefit nearly as much, because
    they don't have as huge enums. The crates in the Rust distribution that
    I measured saw basically no change in compile times (I only tried
    optimized builds) and only 1-2% reduction in peak memory usage.
