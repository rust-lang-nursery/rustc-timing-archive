    Auto merge of #31253 - ranma42:improve-unicode-iter-offset, r=brson
    
    Improve computation of offset in `EscapeUnicode`
    
    Unify the computation of `offset` and use `leading_zeros` instead of manually scanning the bits.
    This PR removes some duplicated code and makes it a little simpler .
    The computation of `offset` is also faster, but it is unlikely to have an impact on actual code.
