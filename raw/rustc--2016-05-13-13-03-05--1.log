    Copy more libraries from local Rust to stage0
    
    When bootstrapping Rust using a previously built toolchain, I noticed
    a number of libraries were not copied in. As a result the copied in
    rustc fails to execute because it can't find all its dependences.
    
    Add them into the local_stage0.sh script.
cfg: version 1.10.0-dev (bc5789902 2016-05-13)
