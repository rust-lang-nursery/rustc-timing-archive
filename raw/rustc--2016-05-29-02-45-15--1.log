    Auto merge of #33848 - alexcrichton:android-gdb-sysroot, r=michaelwoerister
    
    test: Use `set sysroot` for more NDK compatibility
    
    Recent versions of the Android NDK no longer ship debuggers like
    `arm-linux-androideabi-gdb`, but instead one prebuilt binary `gdb`. We can
    symlink this into place at least to get our detection still working, but it now
    needs to be told what the sysroot is so it can correctly do... something. Long
    story short, tests didn't pass with this change and after this change they pass.
