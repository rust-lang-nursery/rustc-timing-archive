    rustbuild: Package librustc & co for cross-hosts
    
    Currently the `rust-std` package produced by rustbuild only contains the
    standard library plus libtest, but the makefiles actually produce a `rust-std`
    package with all known target libraries (including libsyntax, librustc, etc).
    Tweak the behavior so the dependencies of the `dist-docs` step in rustbuild
    depend on the compiler libraries as well (so that they're all packaged).
    
    Closes #32984
rustc: ./piston-image-0.3.11
cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes -Zinput-stats
   Compiling png v0.3.1
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
