    mk: Fix bootstrapping cross-hosts on beta
    
    The beta builds are currently failing, unfortunately, due to what is presumably
    some odd behavior with our makefiles. The wrong bootstrap key is being used to
    generate the stage1 cross-compiled libraries, which fails the build.
    Interestingly enough if the targets are directly specified as part of the build
    then it works just fine! Just a bare `make` fails...
    
    Instead of trying to understand what's happening in the makefiles instead just
    tweak how we configure the bootstrap key in a way that's more likely to work.
cfg: version 1.11.0-dev (7746a334d 2016-05-28)
cfg: build triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: host triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: target triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: host for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is x86_64
cfg: os for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: have good valgrind for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: using CC=gcc (CFG_CC)
cfg: disabling valgrind run-pass tests
make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.
