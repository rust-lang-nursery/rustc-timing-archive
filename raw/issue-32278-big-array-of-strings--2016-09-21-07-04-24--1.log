    trans: Only instantiate #[inline] functions in codegen units referencing them
    
    This PR changes how `#[inline]` functions are translated. Before, there was one "master instance" of the function with `external` linkage and a number of on-demand instances with `available_externally` linkage in each codegen unit that referenced the function. This had two downsides:
    
    * Public functions marked with `#[inline]` would be present in machine code of libraries unnecessarily (see #36280 for an example)
    * LLVM would crash on `i686-pc-windows-msvc` due to what I suspect to be a bug in LLVM's Win32 exception handling code, because it doesn't like `available_externally` there (#36309).
    
    This PR changes the behavior, so that there is no master instance and only on-demand instances with `internal` linkage. The downside of this is potential code-bloat if LLVM does not completely inline away the `internal` instances because then there'd be N instances of the function instead of 1. However, this can only become a problem when using more than one codegen unit per crate.
