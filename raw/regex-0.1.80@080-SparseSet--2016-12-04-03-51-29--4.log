    Auto merge of #37920 - nikomatsakis:compile-time-regression-37864, r=mw
    
    in region, treat current (and future) item-likes alike
    
    The `visit_fn` code mutates its surrounding context.  Between *items*,
    this was saved/restored, but between impl items it was not. This meant
    that we wound up with `CallSiteScope` entries with two parents (or
    more!).  As far as I can tell, this is harmless in actual type-checking,
    since the regions you interact with are always from at most one of those
    branches. But it can slow things down.
    
    Before, the effect was limited, since it only applied to impl items
    within an impl. After #37660, impl items are visisted all together at
    the end, and hence this could create a very messed up
    hierarchy. Isolating impl item properly solves both issues.
    
    I cannot come up with a way to unit-test this; for posterity, however,
    you can observe the messed up hierarchies with a test as simple as the
    following, which would create a callsite scope with two parents both
    before and after
    
    ```
    struct Foo {
    }
    
    impl Foo {
        fn bar(&self) -> usize {
            22
        }
    
        fn baz(&self) -> usize {
            22
        }
    }
    
    fn main() { }
    ```
    
    Fixes #37864.

    cc @pnkfelix -- can you think of a way to make a regr test?
