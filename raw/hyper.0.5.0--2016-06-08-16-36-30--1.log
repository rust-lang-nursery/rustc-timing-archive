    rustc: Try to contain prepends to PATH
    
    This commit attempts to bring our prepends to PATH on Windows when loading
    plugins because we've been seeing quite a few issues with failing to spawn a
    process on Windows, the leading theory of which is that PATH is too large as a
    result of this. Currently this is mostly a stab in the dark as it's not
    confirmed to actually fix the problem, but it's probably not a bad change to
    have anyway!
    
    cc #33844
    Closes #17360
