    Auto merge of #31967 - mitaa:rdoc-refactor, r=alexcrichton
    
    This is mostly cleanup of individual code bits and code reuse for `clean::Attribute` handling.
    
    The only change in behaviour should be that emitted sources are now being recorded and queried when trying to create src-links to local source-files.
