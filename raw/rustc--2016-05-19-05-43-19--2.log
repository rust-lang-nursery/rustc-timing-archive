    Fix for old school error issues, improvements to new school
    
    This PR:
    * Fixes some old school error issues, specifically #33559, #33543, #33366
    * Improves wording borrowck errors with match patterns
    * De-emphasize multi-line spans, so we don't color the single source character when we're trying to say "span starts here"
    * Rollup of #33392 (which should help fix #33390)
