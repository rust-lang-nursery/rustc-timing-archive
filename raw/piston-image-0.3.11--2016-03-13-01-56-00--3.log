    Fix name resolution in lexical scopes
    
    Currently, `resolve_item_in_lexical_scope` does not check the "ribs" (type parameters and local variables). This can allow items that should be shadowed by type parameters to be named.
    
    For example,
    ```rust
    struct T { i: i32 }
    fn f<T>() {
        let t = T { i: 0 }; // This use of `T` resolves to the struct, not the type parameter
    }
    
    mod Foo {
        pub fn f() {}
    }
    fn g<Foo>() {
        Foo::f(); // This use of `Foo` resolves to the module, not the type parameter
    }
    ```
    
    This PR changes `resolve_item_in_lexical_scope` so that it fails when the item is shadowed by a rib (fixes #32120).
    This is a [breaking-change], but it looks unlikely to cause breakage in practice.
