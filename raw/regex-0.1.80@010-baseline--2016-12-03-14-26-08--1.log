    Auto merge of #38079 - BurntSushi:attrtarget, r=alexcrichton
    
    Add new #[target_feature = "..."] attribute.
    
    This commit adds a new attribute that instructs the compiler to emit
    target specific code for a single function. For example, the following
    function is permitted to use instructions that are part of SSE 4.2:
    
        #[target_feature = "+sse4.2"]
        fn foo() { ... }
    
    In particular, use of this attribute does not require setting the
    -C target-feature or -C target-cpu options on rustc.
    
    This attribute does not have any protections built into it. For example,
    nothing stops one from calling the above `foo` function on hosts without
    SSE 4.2 support. Doing so may result in a SIGILL.
    
    I've also expanded the x86 target feature whitelist.
