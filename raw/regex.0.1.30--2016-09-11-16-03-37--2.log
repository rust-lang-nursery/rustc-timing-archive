    Auto merge of #36369 - uweigand:s390x, r=alexcrichton
    
    Add s390x support
    
    This adds support for building the Rust compiler and standard
    library for s390x-linux, allowing a full cross-bootstrap sequence
    to complete.  This includes:
    
    - Makefile/configure changes to allow native s390x builds
    - Full Rust compiler support for the s390x C ABI
      (only the non-vector ABI is supported at this point)
    - Port of the standard library to s390x
    - Update the liblibc submodule to a version including s390x support
    - Testsuite fixes to allow clean "make check" on s390x
    
    Caveats:
    
    - Resets base cpu to "z10" to bring support in sync with the default
      behaviour of other compilers on the platforms.  (Usually, upstream
      supports all older processors; a distribution build may then chose
      to require a more recent base version.)  (Also, using zEC12 causes
      failures in the valgrind tests since valgrind doesn't fully support
      this CPU yet.)
    
    - z13 vector ABI is not yet supported.  To ensure compatible code
      generation, the -vector feature is passed to LLVM.  Note that this
      means that even when compiling for z13, no vector instructions
      will be used.  In the future, support for the vector ABI should be
      added (this will require common code support for different ABIs
      that need different data_layout strings on the same platform).
    
    - Two test cases are (temporarily) ignored on s390x to allow passing
      the test suite.  The underlying issues still need to be fixed:
      * debuginfo/simd.rs fails because of incorrect debug information.
        This seems to be a LLVM bug (also seen with C code).
      * run-pass/union/union-basic.rs simply seems to be incorrect for
        all big-endian platforms.
