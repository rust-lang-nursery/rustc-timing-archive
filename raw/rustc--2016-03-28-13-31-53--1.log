    mk: Add `-C metadata` for compiling crates we ship
    
    This should re-enable all external builds of crates with the same name. Right
    now Cargo doesn't pass `-C metadata` for the top-level library being compiled,
    so if that library is called `libc`, for example, then it won't be able to link
    to the standard library which *also* has a `libc` library compiled without `-C
    metadata`. This can result in naming conflicts which need to be resolved.
    
    By passing `-C metadata` to the in-tree crates we ship it should add some extra
    salt to all symbol names to ensure that they don't collide.
    
    Closes #32532
