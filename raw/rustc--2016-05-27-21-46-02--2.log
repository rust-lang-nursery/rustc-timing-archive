    Perform `cfg` attribute processing during macro expansion and fix bugs
    
    This PR refactors `cfg` attribute processing and fixes bugs. More specifically:
     - It merges gated feature checking for stmt/expr attributes, `cfg_attr` processing, and `cfg` processing into a single fold.
      - This allows feature gated `cfg` variables to be used in `cfg_attr` on unconfigured items. All other feature gated attributes can already be used on unconfigured items.
     - It performs `cfg` attribute processing during macro expansion instead of after expansion so that macro-expanded items are configured the same as ordinary items. In particular, to match their non-expanded counterparts,
      - macro-expanded unconfigured macro invocations are no longer expanded,
      - macro-expanded unconfigured macro definitions are no longer usable, and
      - feature gated `cfg` variables on macro-expanded macro definitions/invocations are now errors.
    
    This is a [breaking-change]. For example, the following would break:
    ```rust
    macro_rules! m {
        () => {
            #[cfg(attr)]
            macro_rules! foo { () => {} }
            foo!(); // This will be an error
    
            macro_rules! bar { () => { fn f() {} } }
            #[cfg(attr)] bar!(); // This will no longer be expanded ...
            fn g() { f(); } // ... so that `f` will be unresolved.
    
            #[cfg(target_thread_local)] // This will be a gated feature error
            macro_rules! baz { () => {} }
        }
    }
    
    m!();
    ```
