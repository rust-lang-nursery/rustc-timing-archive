    rustbuild: Touch up some test suites
    
    This adds in some missing test suites, primarily a few pretty suites. It also starts optimizing tests by default as the current test suite does, but also recognizes `--disable-optimize-tests`.
    
    Currently the optimization of tests isn't recognized by crate tests because Cargo doesn't support the ability to compile an unoptimized test suite against an optimized library. Perhaps a feature to add, though!
cfg: version 1.10.0-dev (91e907345 2016-05-20)
cfg: build triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: host triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: target triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: host for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is x86_64
cfg: os for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: have good valgrind for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: using CC=gcc (CFG_CC)
