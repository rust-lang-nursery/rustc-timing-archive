    Auto merge of #33602 - eddyb:no-trans--check, r=michaelwoerister
    
    Save metadata even with -Z no-trans (e.g. for multi-crate cargo check).
    
    Removes the item symbol map in metadata, as we can now generate them in a deterministic manner.
    The `-Z no-trans` change lets the LLVM passes and linking run, but with just metadata and no code.
    It fails while trying to link a binary because there's no `main` function, which is correct but not good UX.
    
    There's also no way to easily throw away all of the artifacts to rebuild with actual code generation.
    We might want `cargo check` to do that using cargo-internal information and then it would just work.
