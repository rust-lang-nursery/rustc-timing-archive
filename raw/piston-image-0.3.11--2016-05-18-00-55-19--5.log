    Auto merge of #33137 - nikomatsakis:issue-32330-lbr-in-return-type-warning-2, r=aturon
    
    Warnings for issue #32330
    
    This is an extension of the previous PR that issues warnings in more situations than before. It does not handle *all* cases of #32330 but I believe it issues warnings for all cases I've seen in practice.
    
    Before merging I'd like to address:
    
    - open a good issue explaining the problem and how to fix it (I have a [draft writeup][])
    - work on the error message, which I think is not as clear as it could/should be (suggestions welcome)
