    [MIR] track Location in MirVisitor, combine Location
    
    All the users of MirVisitor::visit_statement implement their own statement index tracking.  This PR move the tracking into MirVisitor itself.
    
    Also, there were 2 separate implementations of Location that were identical.  This PR eliminates one of them.
