    Auto merge of #34690 - alexcrichton:clarify-vcvars, r=brson
    
    Clarify rustbuild + msvc + vcvars in README
    
    The invocation of vcvars is only needed for versions of Visual Studio that
    rustbuild or cmake doesn't understand, but if older versions are installed then
    there's no need to call vcvars.
    
    Closes #34576
