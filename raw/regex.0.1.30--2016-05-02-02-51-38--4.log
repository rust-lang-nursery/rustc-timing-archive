    resolve: improve diagnostics and lay groundwork for resolving before ast->hir
    
    This PR improves diagnostics in `resolve` and lays some groundwork for resolving before ast->hir.
    
    More specifically,
     - It removes an API in `resolve` intended for external refactoring tools (see #27493) that appears not to be in active use. The API is incompatible with resolving before ast->hir, but could be rewritten in a more compatible and less intrusive way.
     - It improves the diagnostics for pattern bindings that conflict with `const`s.
     - It improves the diagnostics for modules used as expressions (fixes #33186).
     - It refactors away some uses of the hir map, which is unavavailable before ast->hir lowering.
