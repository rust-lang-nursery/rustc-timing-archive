    Auto merge of #33859 - nrc:save-field-sub, r=pnkfelix
    
    save-analysis: be a bit more defensive with field sub-expressions
    
    Prevents an ice with `(...).f` since the sub-expression is in the AST but not the HIR.
    
    We could actually do better in this specific case, but it doesn't seem worth it.
