    mk: Fix cross-host builds
    
    The change in b20e748 had the unintended consequence of breaking cross-host
    builds as we apparently relied on the incorrect definition of this variable in
    the makefiles. That change, however, was required to get tests passing so we
    couldn't just revert it.
    
    This commit fixes the underlying bug by leaving the "more correct" definition of
    `LD_LIBRARY_PATH_ENV_TARGETDIR` (also fixing it with a hardcoded reference to
    `CFG_BUILD`) and updating the `RPATH_VAR` definition below. Turned out we
    already had special-casing logic for passing `--cfg stage1` during the
    well-we-print-this-as-stage0 build of a cross-host. That logic was just updated
    to pull from a different variable as opposed to relying on the definition of
    that variable to accommodate this.
    
    Closes #32568
