    crate-ify compiler-rt into compiler-builtins
    
    libcompiler-rt.a is dead, long live libcompiler-builtins.rlib
    
    This commit moves the logic that used to build libcompiler-rt.a into a
    compiler-builtins crate on top of the core crate and below the std crate.
    This new crate still compiles the compiler-rt instrinsics using gcc-rs
    but produces an .rlib instead of a static library.
    
    Also, with this commit rustc no longer passes -lcompiler-rt to the
    linker. This effectively makes the "no-compiler-rt" field of target
    specifications a no-op. Users of `no_std` will have to explicitly add
    the compiler-builtins crate to their crate dependency graph *if* they
    need the compiler-rt intrinsics - this is a [breaking-change]. Users
    of the `std` have to do nothing extra as the std crate depends
    on compiler-builtins.
    
    Finally, this a step towards lazy compilation of std with Cargo as the
    compiler-rt intrinsics can now be built by Cargo instead of having to
    be supplied by the user by some other method.
    
    closes #34400
