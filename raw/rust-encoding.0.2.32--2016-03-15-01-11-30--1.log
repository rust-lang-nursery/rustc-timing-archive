    Fix Windows rustbuild
    
    These commits fix the rustbuild Windows bots, namely:
    
    * The 32-bit build of LLVM was failing because libraries weren't being linked. This was in turn caused by the build script for `rustc_llvm` erroneously detecting that it was cross compiling when it actually wasn't.
    * Tools of the build were compiled against the wrong libraries, so running them would fail on Windows as rpath didn't exist and `PATH` was wrong.
    * Some linkchecker fixes for Windows paths had to be applied as well.
