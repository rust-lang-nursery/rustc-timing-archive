    Auto merge of #33319 - birkenfeld:issue31424, r=jseyfried
    
    borrowck: do not suggest to change "&mut self" to "&mut mut self"
    
    Matching the snippet string might not be the cleanest, but matching
    the AST node instead seems to end in a lot of nested `if let`s, so I
    don't know what's better.
    
    Of course it's entirely possible that there is another API altogether
    that I just don't know of?
    
    Fixes #31424.
