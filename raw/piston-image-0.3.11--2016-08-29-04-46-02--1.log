    rustbuild: smarter `git submodule`-ing
    
    With this commit, if one bootstraps rust against system llvm then the
    src/llvm submodule is not updated/checked-out. This saves considerable
    network bandwith when starting from a fresh clone of rust-lang/rust as
    the llvm submodule is never cloned.

    ~~We could also avoid updating the jemalloc submodule if --disable-jemalloc is used. It just hasn't been implemented.~~ Done
    
    This probably doesn't handle "recursive" submodules correctly but I think we don't have any of those right now.
    
    I'm still testing a bootstrap but already confirmed that the llvm submodule doesn't get updated when `--llvm-root` is passed to `configure`.
