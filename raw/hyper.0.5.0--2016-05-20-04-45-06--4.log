    rustc: Add a new crate type, cdylib
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 1510] which adds a new crate type,
    `cdylib`, to the compiler. This new crate type differs from the existing `dylib`
    crate type in a few key ways:
    
    * No metadata is present in the final artifact
    * Symbol visibility rules are the same as executables, that is only reachable
      `extern` functions are visible symbols
    * LTO is allowed
    * All libraries are always linked statically
    
    This commit is relatively simple by just plubming the compiler with another
    crate type which takes different branches here and there. The only major change
    is an implementation of the `Linker::export_symbols` function on Unix which now
    actually does something. This helps restrict the public symbols from a cdylib on
    Unix.
    
    With this PR a "hello world" `cdylib` is 7.2K while the same `dylib` is 2.4MB,
    which is some nice size savings!
    
    [RFC 1510]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1510
    
    Closes #33132
