    [MIR] Fix MIR trans edge cases that showed up on crater.
    
    These fixes cover all of the [regressions found by crater](https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/88ce89ed06ef7f7f19bfd1e221d7f7ec) (for #34096).
    
    Two of them were `Pair` edge cases (ZSTs and constants) causing LLVM assertions, the other one was  causing stack overflows in debug scripts compiled in debug mode, due to the `fn_ret_cast` `alloca` ending up in a loop.
