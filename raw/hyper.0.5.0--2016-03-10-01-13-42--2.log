    Auto merge of #31710 - eddyb:reify, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Distinguish fn item types to allow reification from nothing to fn pointers.
    
    The first commit is a rebase of #26284, except for files that have moved since.
    
    This is a [breaking-change], due to:
    * each FFI function has a distinct type, like all other functions currently do
    * all generic parameters on functions are recorded in their item types, e.g.:
    `size_of::<u8>` & `size_of::<i8>`'s types differ despite their identical signature.
    * function items are zero-sized, which will stop transmutes from working on them
    
    The first two cases are handled in most cases with the new coerce-unify logic,
    which will combine incompatible function item types into function pointers,
    at the outer-most level of if-else chains, match arms and array literals.
    
    The last case is specially handled during type-checking such that transmutes
    from a function item type to a pointer or integer type will continue to work for
    another release cycle, but are being linted against. To get rid of warnings and
    ensure your code will continue to compile, cast to a pointer before transmuting.
