    Auto merge of #31846 - alexcrichton:better-disable-jemallc, r=brson
    
    The `--disable-jemalloc` configure option has a failure mode where it will
    create a distribution that is not compatible with other compilers. For example
    the nightly for Linux will assume that it will link to jemalloc by default as
    an allocator for executable crates. If, however, a standard library is used
    which was built via `./configure --disable-jemalloc` then this will fail
    because the jemalloc crate wasn't built.
    
    While this seems somewhat reasonable as a niche situation, the same mechanism is
    used for disabling jemalloc for platforms that just don't support it. For
    example if the rumprun target is compiled then the sibiling Linux target *also*
    doesn't have jemalloc. This is currently a problem for our cross-build nightlies
    which build many targets. If rumprun is also built, it will disable jemalloc for
    all targets, which isn't desired.
    
    This commit moves the platform-specific disabling of jemalloc as hardcoded logic
    into the makefiles that is scoped per-platform. This way when configuring
    multiple targets **without the `--disable-jemalloc` option specified** all
    targets will get jemalloc as they should.
