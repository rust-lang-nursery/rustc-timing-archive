     [MIR] Fix double-rounding of float constants and ignore NaN sign in tests.
    
    Fixes #32805 by handling f32 and f64 separately in rustc_const_eval.
    
    Also removes `#[rustc_no_mir]` from a couple libstd tests by ignoring NaN sign.
    Turns out that runtime evaluation of `0.0 / 0.0` produces a NaN with the sign bit set,
    whereas LLVM constant folds it to a NaN with the sign bit unset, which we were testing for.
