    trans: Always lower to `frem`
    
    Long ago LLVM unfortunately didn't handle the 32-bit MSVC case of `frem` where
    it can't be lowered to `fmodf` because that symbol doesn't exist. That was since
    fixed in http://reviews.llvm.org/D12099 (landed as r246615) and was released in
    what appears to be LLVM 3.8. Now that we're using that branch of LLVM let's
    remove our own hacks and help LLVM optimize a little better by giving it
    knowledge about what we're doing.

cfg: build triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: host triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: target triples x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: host for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is x86_64
cfg: os for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: have good valgrind for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cfg: using CC=gcc (CFG_CC)
