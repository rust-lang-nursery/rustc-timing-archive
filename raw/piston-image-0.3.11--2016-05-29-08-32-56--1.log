    Auto merge of #33934 - Byron:libsyntex-ring-buffer-size, r=pnkfelix
    
    Prevent overflows by increasing ring buffer size
    
    Please note that this change is just done to prevent
    issues as currently seen by syntex_syntax in future.
    See https://github.com/serde-rs/syntex/pull/47 for details.
    
    As shown in https://github.com/serde-rs/syntex/issues/33,
    complex code can easily overflow the ring-buffer and
    cause an assertion error.
