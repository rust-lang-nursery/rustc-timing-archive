    mk: Distribute fewer TARGET_CRATES
    
    Right now everything in TARGET_CRATES is built by default for all non-fulldeps
    tests and is distributed by default for all target standard library packages.
    Currenly this includes a number of unstable crates which are rarely used such as
    `graphviz` and `rbml`>
    
    This commit trims down the set of `TARGET_CRATES`, moves a number of tests to
    `*-fulldeps` as a result, and trims down the dependencies of libtest so we can
    distribute fewer crates in the `rust-std` packages.
