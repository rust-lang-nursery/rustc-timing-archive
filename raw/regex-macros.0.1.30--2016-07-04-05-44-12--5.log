    Auto merge of #34638 - zackmdavis:if_let_over_none_empty_block_arm, r=jseyfried
    
    prefer `if let` to match with `None => {}` arm in some places
    
    This is a spiritual succesor to #34268 / 8531d581, in which we replaced a
    number of matches of None to the unit value with `if let` conditionals
    where it was judged that this made for clearer/simpler code (as would be
    recommended by Manishearth/rust-clippy's `single_match` lint). The same
    rationale applies to matches of None to the empty block.
