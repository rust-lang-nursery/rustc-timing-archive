    feat: reinterpret `precision` field for strings
    
    This commit changes the behavior of formatting string arguments with both width and precision fields set.
    
    Documentation says that the `width` field is the "minimum width" that the format should take up. If the value's string does not fill up this many characters, then the padding specified by fill/alignment will be used to take up the required space.
    
    This is true for all formatted types except string, which is truncated down to `precision` number of chars and then all of `fill`, `align` and `width` fields are completely ignored.
    
    For example: `format!("{:/^10.8}", "1234567890);` emits "12345678". In the contrast Python version works as the expected:
    ```python
    >>> '{:/^10.8}'.format('1234567890')
    '/12345678/'
    ```
    
    This commit gives back the `Python` behavior by changing the `precision` field meaning to the truncation and nothing more. The result string *will* be prepended/appended up to the `width` field with the proper `fill` char.
    
    __However, this is the breaking change, I admit.__ Feel free to close it, but otherwise it should be mentioned in the `std::fmt` documentation somewhere near of `fill/align/width` fields description.
