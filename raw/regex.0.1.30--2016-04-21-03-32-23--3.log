    MIR: Do not require END_BLOCK to always exist
    
    Basically, all this does, is removing restriction for END_BLOCK to exist past the first invocation of RemoveDeadBlocks pass. This way for functions whose CFG does not reach the `END_BLOCK` end up not containing the block.
    
    As far as the implementation goes, I’m not entirely satisfied with the `BasicBlock::end_block`. I had hoped to make `new` a `const fn` and then just have a `const END_BLOCK` private to mir::build, but it turns out that constant functions don’t yet support conditionals nor a way to assert.
