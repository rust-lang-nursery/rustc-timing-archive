    Auto merge of #34187 - luser:extern-crate-abspaths, r=michaelwoerister
    
    Add an abs_path member to FileMap, use it when writing debug info.
    
    Fixes #34179.
    
    When items are inlined from extern crates, the filename in the debug info
    is taken from the FileMap that's serialized in the rlib metadata.
    Currently this is just FileMap.name, which is whatever path is passed to rustc.
    Since libcore and libstd are built by invoking rustc with relative paths,
    they wind up with relative paths in the rlib, and when linked into a binary
    the debug info uses relative paths for the names, but since the compilation
    directory for the final binary, tools trying to read source filenames
    will wind up with bad paths. We noticed this in Firefox with source
    filenames from libcore/libstd having bad paths.
    
    This change stores an absolute path in FileMap.abs_path, and uses that
    if available for writing debug info. This is not going to magically make
    debuggers able to find the source, but it will at least provide sensible
    paths.
