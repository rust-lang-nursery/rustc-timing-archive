    Auto merge of #33317 - michaelwoerister:fix-partitioning-tests-race, r=alexcrichton
    
    Fix a race condition caused by concurrently executed codegen unit tests.
    
    This hopefully fixes issue #33315.
    
    This short-term solution just makes sure that every test uses its own directory so they can't get into conflict with each other.
    
    As a more long-term solution, I'd probably prefer to make the partitioning scheme specifiable via `-Ccodegen-units` (e.g. like `-Ccodegen-units=per-module`) so that we don't have to rely on `-Zincremental` in these test cases.
