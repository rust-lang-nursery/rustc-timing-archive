    configure: Support --disable-option-checking
    
    I'm trying to package Rust for Fedora (this is nothing official (yet)).
    
    The standard RPM packaging process involves running `./configure` with a whole lot of options that are commonly recognized by autotools configure scripts, but not by Rust's one. Since it does not make much sense to support all of this options, I think it would be great to support at least `--disable-option-checking`, so Rust's configure script would not fail.
    
    [The old attempt](https://github.com/fabiand/rust-spec/blob/master/rustc.spec) to package Rust used a sed script (at line 72), but this is not the recommended way to do that.
