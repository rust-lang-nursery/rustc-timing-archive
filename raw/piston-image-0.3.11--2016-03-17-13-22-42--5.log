    Auto merge of #32263 - frewsxcv:compiletest-ignored-expected, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Stop ignoring expected note/help messages in compiletest suite.
    
    Original issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21195
    
    Relevant PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30778
    
    Prior to this commit, if a compiletest testcase included the text
    "HELP:" or "NOTE:" (note the colons), then it would indicate to the
    compiletest suite that we should verify "help" and "note" expected
    messages.
    
    This commit updates this check to also check "HELP" and "NOTE" (not the
    absense of colons) so that we always verify "help" and "note" expected
    messages.
