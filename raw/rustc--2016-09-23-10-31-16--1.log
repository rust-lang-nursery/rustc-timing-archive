    Fix ICE test in compiletest fail-tests
    
    While working on Clippy which uses *compiletest*, I noticed that as long as all expected error are found, *compile-fail* tests will be marked *ok* even if there is an ICE. One function seems to have not been updated with JSON errors because ICEs are now reported like this:
    ```json
    {"message":"../src/librustc/ty/context.rs:161: Attempted to intern `_` which contains inference types/regions in the global type context","code":null,"level":"error: internal compiler error","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}
    ```
    I don't think I can add a test for that.
    
    I guess:
