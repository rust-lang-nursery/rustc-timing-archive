    Separate bindings from other patterns in HIR
    
    Now when name resolution is done on AST, we can avoid dumping everything that looks like an identifier into `PatKind::Ident` in HIR.
    `hir::PatKind::Ident` is removed, fresh bindings are now called `hir::PatKind::Binding`, everything else goes to `hir::PatKind::Path`.
    
    I intend to do something with `PatKind::Path`/`PatKind::QPath` as well using resolution results, but it requires some audit and maybe some deeper refactoring of relevant resolution/type checking code to do it properly.
    I'm submitting this part of the patch earlier to notify interested parties that I'm working on this.
