    trans: Always lower to `frem`
    
    Long ago LLVM unfortunately didn't handle the 32-bit MSVC case of `frem` where
    it can't be lowered to `fmodf` because that symbol doesn't exist. That was since
    fixed in http://reviews.llvm.org/D12099 (landed as r246615) and was released in
    what appears to be LLVM 3.8. Now that we're using that branch of LLVM let's
    remove our own hacks and help LLVM optimize a little better by giving it
    knowledge about what we're doing.
