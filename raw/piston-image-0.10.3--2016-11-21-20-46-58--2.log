    Auto merge of #37642 - nnethercote:no-HirVec-of-P, r=michaelwoerister
    
    Change HirVec<P<T>> to HirVec<T> in hir:: Expr.
    
    This PR changes data structures like this:
    ```
    [ ExprArray | 8 | P ]
                      |
                      v
                      [ P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P ]
                        |
                        v
                        [ ExprTup | 2 | P ]
                                        |
                                        v
                                        [ P | P ]
                                          |
                                          v
                                          [ Expr ]
    ```
    to this:
    ```
    [ ExprArray | 8 | P ]
                      |
                      v
                      [ [ ExprTup | 2 | P ] | ... ]
                                        |
                                        v
                                        [ Expr | Expr ]
    ```
    I thought this would be a win for #36799, and on a cut-down version of that workload this reduces the peak heap size (as measured by Massif) from 885 MiB to 875 MiB. However, the peak RSS as measured by `-Ztime-passes` and by `/usr/bin/time` increases by about 30 MiB.
    
    I'm not sure why. Just look at the picture above -- the second data structure clearly takes up less space than the first. My best idea relates to unused elements in the slices. `HirVec<Expr>` is a typedef for `P<[Expr]>`. If there were any unused excess elements then I could see that memory usage would increase, because those excess elements are larger in `HirVec<Expr>` than in `HirVec<P<Expr>>`. But AIUI there are no such excess elements, and Massif's measurements corroborate that.
    
    However, the two main creation points for these data structures are these lines from `lower_expr`:
    ```rust
            ExprKind::Vec(ref exprs) => {
                hir::ExprArray(exprs.iter().map(|x| self.lower_expr(x)).collect())
            }
            ExprKind::Tup(ref elts) => {
                hir::ExprTup(elts.iter().map(|x| self.lower_expr(x)).collect())
            }
    ```
    I suspect what is happening is that temporary excess elements are created within the `collect` calls. The workload from #36799 has many 2-tuples and 3-tuples and when `Vec` gets doubled it goes from a capacity of 1 to 4, which would lead to excess elements. Though, having said that, `Vec::with_capacity` doesn't create excess AFAICT. So I'm not sure. What goes on inside `collect` is complex.
    
    Anyway, in its current form this PR is a memory consumption regression and so not worth landing but I figured I'd post it in case anyone has additional insight.
