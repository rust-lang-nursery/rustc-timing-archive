    Auto merge of #33895 - AndrewBrinker:master, r=steveklabnik
    
    Rewrote "How Safe and Unsafe Interact" Nomicon chapter.
    
    The previous version of the chapter covered a lot of ground, but was a little meandering and hard to follow at times. This draft is intended to be clearer and more direct, while still providing the same information as the previous version.
