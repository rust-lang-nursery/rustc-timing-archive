    Auto merge of #31317 - jseyfried:remove_external_module_children, r=nrc
    
    This PR refactors away `Module`'s `external_module_children` and instead puts `extern crate` declarations in `children` like other items, simplifying duplicate checking and name resolution.
    
    This PR also allows values to share a name with extern crates, which are only defined in the type namespace. Other than that, it is a pure refactoring.
