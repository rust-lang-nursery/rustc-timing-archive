    rustc: add ReErased to be used by trait selection, MIR and trans.
    
    `ReErased` replaces `ReStatic` (i.e. `'static`) for erasing regions.
    Using a distinct lifetime helps prevent accidental mix-ups between the two.
    It also allows cleaner type printing (see test changes), including in symbol names:
    ```rust
    str..pattern..CharSearcher$LT$$u27$static$GT$::drop.30560::h840c2f2afc03bbea // before
    str..pattern..CharSearcher::drop.30561::h6bd31d2af614377a // after
    ```
    Not that we should be producing symbols this way, but it's still better.
