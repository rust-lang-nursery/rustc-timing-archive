    Restrict where in the tree platform-specific cfgs may be mentioned
    
    With the ports of Rust never ending, it's important that we keep things tidy. The main thing this PR does is introduce  a new "pal" (platform abstraction layer) tidy check that limits where platform-specific CFGs may appear.
    
    This is intended to maintain existing standards of code organization
    in hopes that the standard library will continue to be refactored to
    isolate platform-specific bits, making porting easier; where "standard
    library" roughly means "all the dependencies of the std and test
    crates".
    
    This generally means placing restrictions on where `cfg(unix)`,
    `cfg(windows)`, `cfg(target_os)` and `cfg(target_env)` may appear,
    the basic objective being to isolate platform-specific code to the
    platform-specific `std::sys` modules, and to the allocation,
    unwinding, and libc crates.
    
    Following are the basic rules, though there are currently
    exceptions:
    
    - core may not have platform-specific code
    - liballoc_system may have platform-specific code
    - liballoc_jemalloc may have platform-specific code
    - libpanic_abort may have platform-specific code
    - libpanic_unwind may have platform-specific code
    - other crates in the std facade may not
    - std may have platform-specific code in the following places
      - sys/unix/
      - sys/windows/
      - os/
    
    There are plenty of exceptions today though, noted in the whitelist.
    
    The end-state, IMO, is for the standard library to be portable by porting only `std::sys` (possibly extracted to its own crate), an allocator crate, an unwinder crate, and possibly a libc crate (if std depends on it); but that outcome is far off and independent of the utility of enforcing where such code lives today.
