    core: add likely and unlikely intrinsics
    
    I'm no good at reading assembly, but I have tried a stage1 compiler with this patch, and it does cause different asm output. Additionally, testing this compiler on my httparse crate with some `likely` usage added in to the branches does affect benchmarks. However, I'm sure a codegen test should be included, if anyone knows what it should look like.
    
    There isn't an entry in `librustc_trans/context.rs` in this diff, because it already exists (`llvm.expect.i1` is used for array indices).
    
    ----
    
    Even though this does affect httparse benchmarks, it doesn't seem to affect it the same way GCC's `__builtin_expect` affects picohttpparser. I was confused that the deviation on the benchmarks grew hugely when testing this, especially since I'm absolutely certain that the branchs where I added `likely` were always `true`. I chalk that up to GCC and LLVM handle branch prediction differently.
