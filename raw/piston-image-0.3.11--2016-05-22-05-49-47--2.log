    Auto merge of #33765 - alex-ozdemir:master, r=Manishearth
    
    Added a `rustdoc` shortcut for collapse/expand all
    
    Now when the user presses the "+" key all sections will collapse/expand.
    
    Also added a note to the help screen which describes this behavior.
    
    This required increasing the height of the help screen.
