    Auto merge of #33020 - nikomatsakis:compiletest-json, r=alexcrichton
    
    port compiletest to use JSON output
    
    This uncovered a lot of bugs in compiletest and also some shortcomings
    of our existing JSON output. We had to add information to the JSON
    output, such as suggested text and macro backtraces. We also had to fix
    various bugs in the existing tests.
    
    Joint work with @jonathandturner.
