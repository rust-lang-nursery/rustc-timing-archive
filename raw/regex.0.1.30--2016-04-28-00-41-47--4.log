    Feature gate clean
    
    This PR does a bit of cleaning in the feature-gate-handling code of libsyntax. It also fixes two bugs (#32782 and #32648). Changes include:
    
    * Change the way the existing features are declared in `feature_gate.rs`. The array of features and the `Features` struct are now defined together by a single macro. `featureck.py` has been updated accordingly. Note: there are now three different arrays for active, removed and accepted features instead of a single one with a `Status` item to tell wether a feature is active, removed, or accepted. This is mainly due to the way I implemented my macro in the first time and I can switch back to a single array if needed. But an advantage of the way it is now is that when an active feature is used, the parser only searches through the list of active features. It goes through the other arrays only if the feature is not found. I like to think that error checking (in this case, checking that an used feature is active) does not slow down compilation of valid code. :) But this is not very important...
    * Feature-gate checking pass now use the `Features` structure instead of looking through a string vector. This should speed them up a bit. The construction of the `Features` struct should be faster too since it is build directly when parsing features instead of calling `has_feature` dozens of times.
    * The MacroVisitor pass has been removed, it was mostly useless since the `#[cfg]-stripping` phase happens before (fixes #32648). The features that must actually be checked before expansion are now checked at the time they are used. This also allows us to check attributes that are generated by macro expansion and not visible to MacroVisitor, but are also removed by macro expansion and thus not visible to PostExpansionVisitor either. This fixes #32782. Note that in order for `#[derive_*]` to be feature-gated but still accepted when generated by `#[derive(Trait)]`, I had to do a little bit of trickery with spans that I'm not totally confident into. Please review that part carefully. (It's in `libsyntax_ext/deriving/mod.rs`.)::
    
    Note: this is a [breaking change], since programs with feature-gated attributes on macro-generated macro invocations were not rejected before. For example:
    
    ```rust
    macro_rules! bar (
        () => ()
    );
    
    macro_rules! foo (
        () => (
            #[allow_internal_unstable] //~ ERROR allow_internal_unstable side-steps
            bar!();
        );
    );
    ```
    foo!();
