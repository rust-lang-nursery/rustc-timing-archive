    trans: generalize immediate temporaries to all MIR locals.
    
    Added `Mir::local_index` which gives you an unified index for `Arg`, `Var`, `Temp` and `ReturnPointer`.
    Also available is `Mir::count_locals` which returns the total number of the above locals.
    This simplifies a lot of the code which can treat all of the local lvalues in the same manner.
    If we had `-> impl Iterator`, I could have added a bunch of useful `Ty` or `Lvalue` iterators for all locals.
    We could of course manually write such iterators as they are needed.
    
    The only place which currently takes advantage of unified locals is trans' alloca elision.
    Currently it's not as good as it could be, due to our usage of `llvm.dbg.declare` in debug mode.
    But passing some arguments and variables as immediates has some effect on release-mode `libsyntax`:
