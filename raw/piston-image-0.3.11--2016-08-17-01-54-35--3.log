    Auto merge of #35559 - frewsxcv:slice-iter-as-ref, r=alexcrichton
    
    Implement `AsRef<[T]>` for `std::slice::Iter`.
    
    `AsRef` is designed for conversions that are "cheap" (as per
    the API docs). It is the case that retrieving the underlying
    data of `std::slice::Iter` is cheap. In my opinion, there's no
    ambiguity about what slice data will be returned, otherwise,
    I would be more cautious about implementing `AsRef`.
