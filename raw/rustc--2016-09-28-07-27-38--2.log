    libtest: add a --skip flag to the test runner
    
    This flag takes a FILTER argument and instructs the test runner to skip
    the tests whose names contain the word FILTER. --skip can be used
    several times.

    My motivation for submitting this is that while using [smoke] to run `std` unit tests for cross
    targets I found that a few of the tests always fail due to limitations in QEMU (it can't handle too
    many threads) and I'd like to skip these problematic tests from the command line to be able to run
    the rest of the unit tests.

    I know there is another mechanism to skip tests: `#[ignore]` but this doesn't work in my use case
    because I can't (easily) modify the source of the standard libraries to `#[ignore]` some tests. And
    even if I could, the change would involve conditionally ignoring some tests for some targets but
    that's not a perfect solution because those tests should pass if executed on real hardware so they
    should not be `#[ignored]` in that scenario.
