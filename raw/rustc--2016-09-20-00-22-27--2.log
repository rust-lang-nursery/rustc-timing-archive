    Fix overflow checking in unsigned pow()
    
    The pow() method for unsigned integers produced 0 instead of trapping overflow for certain inputs. Calls such as 2u32.pow(1024) produced 0 when they should trap an overflow. This also adds tests for the correctly handling overflow in unsigned pow().
    
    This was previously fixed for signed integers in #28248, but it seems unsigned integers got missed that time.
