    Auto merge of #29498 - wthrowe:replace-pattern, r=alexcrichton
    
    It appears this was left out of RFC rust-lang/rfcs#528 because it might be useful to
    also generalize the second argument in some way.  That doesn't seem to
    prevent generalizing the first argument now, however.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] because it could cause type-inference to
    fail where it previously succeeded.
    
    Also update docs for a few other methods that still referred to `&str` instead of patterns.
