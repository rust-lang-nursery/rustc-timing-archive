    Auto merge of #31937 - petrochenkov:field, r=eddyb
    
    The names are "0", "1", "2" etc, the same as used in field access.
    
    This generally make things simpler and potentially allows to reuse braced struct machinery (struct patterns, struct expressions) for tuple structs.
    
    I haven't touched the AST for stability reasons, but I intend to do it later.
