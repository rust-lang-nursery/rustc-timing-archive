    trans: Make type names in LLVM IR independent of crate-nums and source locations.
    
    UPDATE:
    This PR makes the type names we assign in LLVM IR independent of the type definition's location in the source code and the order in which extern crates are loaded. The new type names look like the old ones, except for closures and the `<crate-num>.` prefix being gone. Resolution of name clashes (e.g. of the same type in different crate versions) is left to LLVM (which will just append `.<counter>` to the name).
    
    ORIGINAL TEXT:
    This PR makes the type names we assign in LLVM IR independent of the type definition's location in the source code. Before, the type of closures contained the closures definition location. The new naming scheme follows the same pattern that we already use for symbol names: We have a human readable prefix followed by a hash that makes sure we don't have any collisions. Here is an example of what the new names look like:
    
    ```rust
    // prog.rs - example program
    
    mod mod1
    {
        pub struct Struct<T>(pub T);
    }
    
    fn main() {
        use mod1::Struct;
    
        let _s = Struct(0u32);
        let _t = Struct('h');
        let _x = Struct(Struct(0i32));
    }
    ```
    Old:
    ```llvm
    %"mod1::Struct<u32>" = type { i32 }
    %"mod1::Struct<char>" = type { i32 }
    %"mod1::Struct<mod1::Struct<i32>>" = type { %"mod1::Struct<i32>" }
    %"mod1::Struct<i32>" = type { i32 }
    ```
    New:
    ```llvm
    %"prog::mod1::Struct<u32>::ejDrT" = type { i32 }
    %"prog::mod1::Struct<char>::2eEAU" = type { i32 }
    %"prog::mod1::Struct<prog::mod1::Struct<i32>>::ehCqR" = type { %"prog::mod1::Struct<i32>::$fAo2" }
    %"prog::mod1::Struct<i32>::$fAo2" = type { i32 }
    ```
    
    As you can see, the new names are slightly more verbose, but also more consistent. There is no difference now between a local type and one from another crate (before, non-local types where prefixed with `<crate-num>.` as in `2.std::mod1::Type1`).
    
    There is a bit of design space here. For example, we could leave off the crate name for local definitions (making names shorter but less consistent):
    ```llvm
    %"mod1::Struct<u32>::ejDrT" = type { i32 }
    %"mod1::Struct<char>::2eEAU" = type { i32 }
    %"mod1::Struct<mod1::Struct<i32>>::ehCqR" = type { %"mod1::Struct<i32>::$fAo2" }
    %"mod1::Struct<i32>::$fAo2" = type { i32 }
    ```
    
    We could also put the hash in front, which might be more readable:
    ```llvm
    %"ejDrT.mod1::Struct<u32>" = type { i32 }
    %"2eEAU.mod1::Struct<char>" = type { i32 }
    %"ehCqR.mod1::Struct<mod1::Struct<i32>>" = type { %"$fAo2.mod1::Struct<i32>" }
    %"$fAo2.mod1::Struct<i32>" = type { i32 }
    ```
    
    We could probably also get rid of the hash if we used full DefPaths and crate-nums (though I'm not yet a 100% sure if crate-nums could mess with incremental compilation).
    
    ```llvm
    %"mod1::Struct<u32>" = type { i32 }
    %"mod1::Struct<char>" = type { i32 }
    %"mod1::Struct<mod1::Struct<i32>>" = type { %"mod1::Struct<i32>" }
    %"mod1::Struct<i32>" = type { i32 }
    %"2.std::mod1::Type1" = type { ... }
    ```
    I would prefer the solution with the hashes because it is nice and consistent conceptually, but visually it's admittedly a bit uglier. Maybe @rust-lang/compiler would like to bikeshed a little about this.
    
    On a related note: Has anyone ever tried if the LTO-linker will merge equal types with different names?
    (^ @brson, @alexcrichton ^)
    If not, that would be a reason to make type names more consistent.
