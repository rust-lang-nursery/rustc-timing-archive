    Auto merge of #31307 - nagisa:mir-drop-terminator, r=nikomatsakis
    
    The scope of these refactorings is a little bit bigger than the title implies. See each commit for details.
    
    I’m submitting this for nitpicking now (the first 4 commits), because I feel the basic idea/implementation is sound and should work. I will eventually expand this PR to cover the translator changes necessary for all this to work (+ tests), ~~and perhaps implement a dynamic dropping scheme while I’m at it as well.~~
