    Implement the `!` type
    
    This implements the never type (`!`) and hides it behind the feature gate `#[feature(never_type)]`. With the feature gate off, things should build as normal (although some error messages may be different). With the gate on, `!` is usable as a type and diverging type variables (ie. types that are unconstrained by anything in the code) will default to `!` instead of `()`.
