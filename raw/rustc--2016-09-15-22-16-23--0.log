    rustbuild: Fix dependency tracking with new Cargo
    
    The recent Cargo update changed filenames, which broke a lot of incremental
    rustbuild builds. What it thought were the output files were indeed no longer
    the output files! (wreaking havoc).
    
    This commit updates this to stop guessing filenames of Cargo and just manage
    stamp files instead.
