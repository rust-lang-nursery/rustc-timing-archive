    Auto merge of #36124 - eddyb:fast-array-init, r=alexcrichton
    
    Fix optimization regressions for operations on [x; n]-initialized arrays.
    
    Fixes #35662 by using `!=` instead of `<` as the stop condition for `[x; n]` initialization loops.
    Also included is https://github.com/eddyb/llvm/commit/cc2009f02d3b9a3c05be939978212e832310b3d6, a hack to run the GVN pass twice, another time after InstCombine.
    This hack results in removal of redundant `memset` and `memcpy` calls (from loops over arrays).
    
    cc @nrc Can we get performance numbers on this? Not sure if it regresses anything else.
