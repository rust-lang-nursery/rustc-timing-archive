    Copy more libraries from local Rust to stage0
    
    When bootstrapping Rust using a previously built toolchain, I noticed
    a number of libraries were not copied in. As a result the copied in
    rustc fails to execute because it can't find all its dependences.
    
    Add them into the local_stage0.sh script.
rustc: ./piston-image-0.3.11
cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes -Zinput-stats
   Compiling png v0.3.1
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
