    rustbuild: Add support for crate tests + doctests
    
    This commit adds support to rustbuild to run crate unit tests (those defined by
    `#[test]`) as well as documentation tests. All tests are powered by `cargo test`
    under the hood.
    
    Each step requires the `libtest` library is built for that corresponding stage.
    Ideally the `test` crate would be a dev-dependency, but for now it's just easier
    to ensure that we sequence everything in the right order.
    
    Currently no filtering is implemented, so there's not actually a method of
    testing *only* libstd or *only* libcore, but rather entire swaths of crates are
    tested all at once.
    
    A few points of note here are:
    
    * The `coretest` and `collectionstest` crates are just listed as `[[test]]`
      entires for `cargo test` to naturally pick up. This mean that `cargo test -p
      core` actually runs all the tests for libcore.
    * Libraries that aren't tested all mention `test = false` in their `Cargo.toml`
    * Crates aren't currently allowed to have dev-dependencies due to
      rust-lang/cargo#860, but we can likely alleviate this restriction once
      workspaces are implemented.
