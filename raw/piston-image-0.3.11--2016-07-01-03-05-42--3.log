    rustbuild: Clean out tmp directory on `make clean`
    
    Right now we generate error index information into this directory, but it's
    never cleaned out. This means that if a build *bounces* because of something in
    this directory it'll continue to cause all future builds to fail because the
    relevant files are never removed.
rustc: ./piston-image-0.3.11
cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes -Zinput-stats
   Compiling png v0.3.1
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
