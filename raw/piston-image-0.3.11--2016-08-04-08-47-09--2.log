    [MIR] Deaggregate structs to enable further optimizations
    
    Currently, we generate MIR like:
    
    ```
    tmp0 = ...;
    tmp1 = ...;
    tmp3 = Foo { a: ..., b: ... };
    ```
    
    This PR implements "deaggregation," i.e.:
    
    ```
    tmp3.0 = ...
    tmp3.1 = ...
    ```
    
    Currently, the code only deaggregates structs, not enums.  My understanding is that we do not have MIR to set the discriminant of an enum.
