    rBreak Critical Edges and other MIR work
    
    This PR is built on top of #32080.
    
    This adds the basic depth-first traversals for MIR, preorder, postorder and reverse postorder. The MIR blocks are now translated using reverse postorder. There is also a transform for breaking critical edges, which includes the edges from `invoke`d calls (`Drop` and `Call`), to account for the fact that we can't add code after an `invoke`. It also stops generating the intermediate block (since the transform essentially does it if necessary already).
    
    The kinds of cases this deals with are difficult to produce, so the test is the one I managed to get. However, it seems to bootstrap with `-Z orbit`, which it didn't before my changes.
