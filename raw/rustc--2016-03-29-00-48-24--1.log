    Auto merge of #32479 - eddyb:eof-not-even-twice, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Prevent bumping the parser past the EOF.
    
    Makes `Parser::bump` after EOF into an ICE, forcing callers to avoid repeated EOF bumps.
    This ICE is intended to break infinite loops where EOF wasn't stopping the loop.
    
    For example, the handling of EOF in `parse_trait_items`' recovery loop fixes #32446.
    But even without this specific fix, the ICE is triggered, which helps diagnosis and UX.
    
    This is a `[breaking-change]` for plugins authors who eagerly eat multiple EOFs.
    See https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs/pull/171 for such an example and the necessary fix.
