    Auto merge of #31457 - lambda:rtabort-use-libc-abort, r=alexcrichton
    
    Use libc::abort, not intrinsics::abort, in rtabort!
    
    intrinsics::abort compiles down to an illegal instruction, which on
    Unix-like platforms causes the process to be killed with SIGILL.  A more
    appropriate way to kill the process would be SIGABRT; this indicates
    better that the runtime has explicitly aborted, rather than some kind of
    compiler bug or architecture mismatch that SIGILL might indicate.
    
    For rtassert!, replace this with libc::abort.  libc::abort raises
    SIGABRT, but is defined to do so in such a way that it will terminate
    the process even if SIGABRT is currently masked or caught by a signal
    handler that returns.
    
    On non-Unix platforms, retain the existing behavior.  On Windows we
    prefer to avoid depending on the C runtime, and we need a fallback for
    any other platforms that may be defined.  An alternative on Windows
    would be to call TerminateProcess, but this seems less essential than
    switching to using SIGABRT on Unix-like platforms, where it is common
    for the process-killing signal to be printed out or logged.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] for any code that depends on the exact
    signal raised to abort a process via rtabort!
