    Improvements to pattern resolution + some refactoring
    
    Continuation of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33929
    First commit is a careful rewrite of `resolve_pattern`, pattern path resolution and new binding creation logic is factored out in separate functions, some minor bugs are fixed. Also, `resolve_possibly_assoc_item` doesn't swallow modules now.
    Later commits are refactorings, see the comment descriptions.
    
    I intend to continue this work later with better support for `Def::Err` in patterns in post-resolve stages and cleanup of pattern resolution code in type checker.
