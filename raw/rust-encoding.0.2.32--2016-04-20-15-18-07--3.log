    doc: Update our tier support
    
    This modifies our listing of tiered platforms a few ways:
    
    * All lists are alphabetized based on target now
    * Lots of targets are moved up to "Tier 2" as we're gating on all these builds
      and official releases are provided (and installable via rustup).
    * A few targets now list having a compiler + cargo now as well.
    
    No more platforms have been moved up to Tier 1 at this time, however. The only
    real candidate is ``x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, but that's not *quite* to a tier
    1 level of quality just yet so let's hold off for another release or so to iron
    it out a bit.
