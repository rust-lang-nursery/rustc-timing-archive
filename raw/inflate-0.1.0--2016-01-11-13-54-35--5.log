    BinaryHeap: Use full sift down in .pop()
    
    .sift_down can either choose to compare the element on the way down (and
    place it during descent), or to sift down an element fully, then sift
    back up to place it.
    
    A previous PR changed .sift_down() to the former behavior, which is much
    faster for relatively small heaps and for elements that are cheap to
    compare.
    
    A benchmarking run suggested that BinaryHeap::pop() suffers
    improportionally from this, and that it should use the second strategy
    instead. It's logical since .pop() brings last element from the
    heapified vector into index 0, it's very likely that this element will
    end up at the bottom again.
    
    Closes #29969
