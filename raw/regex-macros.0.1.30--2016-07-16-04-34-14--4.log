    Auto merge of #34779 - infinity0:master, r=alexcrichton
    
    If local-rust is the same as the current version, then force a local-rebuild
    
    In Debian, we would like the option to build/rebuild the current release from
    *either* the current or previous stable release. So we use enable-local-rust
    instead of enable-local-rebuild, and read the bootstrap key dynamically from
    whatever is installed locally.
    
    In general, it does not make much sense to allow enable-local-rust without also
    setting the bootstrap key, since the build would fail otherwise.
    
    (The way I detect "the bootstrap key of [the local] rustc installation" is a bit hacky, suggestions welcome.)
