    Auto merge of #31838 - aochagavia:trans, r=nrc
    
    Refactor rustc_trans::save to allow other backends than CSV
    
    r? @nrc
    
    Things done:
    * Moved `(.*)Data` structs to an own module, so they can be imported easily (`use data::*`).
    * Created a `Dump` trait with callbacks for dumping items.
    * Refactored `DumpCsvVisitor` to use an implementor of `Dump` instead of dumping as CSV. Renamed it to `DumpVisitor`.
    * Created a `DumpCsv` struct that implements `Dump` and serializes items as CSV.
    
    I tried to extract some of the logic contained in `FmtStr` and `Recorder`, such as normalization of ids (I put it in `DumpVisitor`). I think it makes sense to provide the same information to other implementors of `Dump`, instead of normalizing only for `DumpCsv`. However, there is still some logic related to spans implemented only for `DumpCsv`. I just thought it would be better to merge this as soon as possible, since there are so much changes, and fix this afterwards.
