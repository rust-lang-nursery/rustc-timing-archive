    Auto merge of #38093 - mikhail-m1:stack-overflow, r=arielb1
    
    fix stack overflow by enum and cont issue #36163
    
    some paths were skipped while checking for recursion.
    
    I fixed bug reproduces on win64 cargo test. In previous PR #36458 time complexity was exponential in case of linked const values. Now it's linear.
