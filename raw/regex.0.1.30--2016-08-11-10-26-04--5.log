    Auto merge of #35403 - scottcarr:lvalue_refactor, r=nikomatsakis
    
    refactor lvalue_ty to be method of lvalue
    
    Currently `Mir` (and `MirContext`) implement a method `lvalue_ty` (and actually many more `foo_ty`).  But this should be a method of `Lvalue`.
    
    If you have an `lvalue` and you want to get its type, the natural thing to write is:
    
    ```
    lvalue.ty()
    ```
    
    Of course it needs context, but still:
    
    ```
    lvalue.ty(mir, tcx)
    ```
    
    Makes more sense than
    
    ```
    mir.lvalue_ty(lvalue, tcx)
    ```
    
    I actually think we should go a step farther and have traits so we could get the type of some value generically, but that's up for debate.  The thing I'm running into a lot in the compiler is I have a value of type `Foo` and I know that there is some related type `Bar` which I can get through some combination of method calls, but it's often not as direct as I would imagine.  Unless you already know the code, its not clear why you would look in `Mir` for a method to get the type of an `Lvalue`.
