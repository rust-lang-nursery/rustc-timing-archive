    mk: Try to fix nightlies again
    
    Looks like the real bug on nightlies is that the `llvm-pass` run-make test is
    not actually getting the value of `LLVM_CXXFLAGS` correct. Namely, it's blank!
    Now the only change #33093 which actually affected this is that the argument
    `$(LLVM_CXXFLAGS_$(2))` was moved up from a makefile rule into the definition of
    a variable. Sounds innocuous?
    
    Turns out the variable this was moved into is defined with `:=`, which means
    that it's not recursively expanded, which basically means that it's expanded
    immediately. Unfortunately part of this expansion involves running
    `llvm-config`, which doesn't exist at the start of distcheck build!
    
    This didn't show up on the bots because they run `make` *then* `make check`, and
    the first step builds llvm-config so the next time `make` is loaded everything
    is available. The distcheck bots, however, run just a plain `distcheck` so
    `make` doesn't exist ahead of time. You can see this in action where the
    distcheck bots start out with a bunch of "llvm-config not found" error messages.
    
    This commit just changes a few variables to be defined with `=` which
    essentially means they're lazily expanded. I did not run a full distcheck
    locally, but this makes the initial "llvm-config not found" error messages go
    away so I suspect that this is the fix.
    
    Closes #33379 (hopefully)
