    Auto merge of #30866 - jseyfried:fix_shadowed_use_visibility, r=nrc
    
    This reverts PR #30324, fixing bug #30159 in which a public a glob import makes public any preceding imports that share a name with an item in the module being glob imported from.
    
    For example,
    ```rust
    pub fn f() {}
    pub mod foo {
        fn f() {}
    }
    
    mod bar {
        use f;
        use f as g;
        pub use foo::*; // This makes the first import public but does not affect the second import.
    }
    ```
    
    This is a [breaking-change].
