    Auto merge of #36341 - sagebind:thread_id, r=alexcrichton
    
    Add ThreadId for comparing threads
    
    This adds the capability to store and compare threads with the current calling thread via a new struct, `std::thread::ThreadId`. Addresses the need outlined in issue #21507.
    
    This avoids the need to add any special checks to the existing thread structs and does not rely on the system to provide an identifier for a thread, since it seems that this approach is unreliable and undesirable. Instead, this simply uses a lazily-created, thread-local `usize` whose value is copied from a global atomic counter. The code should be simple enough that it should be as much reliable as the `#[thread_local]` attribute it uses (however much that is).
    
    `ThreadId`s can be compared directly for equality and have copy semantics.
