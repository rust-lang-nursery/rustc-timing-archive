    [7/n] rustc: desugar UFCS in HIR and don't use DefMap for associated resolutions.
    
    _This is part of a series ([prev](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37412) | [next](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37688)) of patches designed to rework rustc into an out-of-order on-demand pipeline model for both better feature support (e.g. [MIR-based](https://github.com/solson/miri) early constant evaluation) and incremental execution of compiler passes (e.g. type-checking), with beneficial consequences to IDE support as well.
    If any motivation is unclear, please ask for additional PR description clarifications or code comments._

    Previously, a path like `T::Assoc::method`, while equivalent to `<<T>::Assoc>::method`, wasn't desugared in any way at the HIR level and everything inspecting it had to either deal with knowing only `T` (before typeck) or knowing only the definition of `method` (after typeck).
    Such a path also had only one `NodeId` and associated resolution during typeck modified `DefMap`, in a way that would be hard for incremental recompilation to track, and inconvenient for partial type conversions from HIR to `Ty`, which are required to break faux-cycles in on-demand type collection.
    
    The desugarings performed by this PR are as follows:
    * `use a::{b,c};` is flattened to `use a as _; use a::b; use a::c;`
      * as resolution is complete, `use a as _;` doesn't do anything, except get checked for stability
    * `Vec::new` (an expression) becomes `Vec<..>::new<..>`, to distinguish it from `<Vec>::new<..>`
      * the "infer all parameters" `<..>` form is internal and not even pretty-printed
      * used when there are no type parameters at all, in an expression or pattern path segment
    * `T::A::B` becomes `<<T>::A>::B` in a type, and `<<T<..>>::A<..>>::B<..>` in an expression/pattern
      * one additional `hir::Ty` node is created for each prefix, starting with the fully-resolved type (`T`) and extending it with each segment (e.g. `<T>::A`)
    * fully-resolved paths contain their `Def` in HIR, getting rid of the `DefMap` and absolving incremental recompilation of needing to manually look up nodes to handle that side information
    
    Not keeping the `DefMap` around meant that associated resolutions had to be stored somewhere else:
    * expressions and patterns use a new `NodeId -> Def` map in `ty::Tables`
      * compatible with the future per-body (constant / `fn` / closure) `Tables`
    * types are accessible via `Ty` and the usual per-item generics / predicates / type
      * `rustdoc` and `save-analysis` are the only situations which insist on mapping syntactical types to semantical ones, or at least understand the resolution of associated types, therefore the type conversion cache, i.e. a `NodeId -> Ty` map, is exposed by typeck for this purpose
      * stability had to be split into a pass that runs on HIR and checks the results of name resolution, and impromptu checks triggered by `typeck` for associated paths, methods, fields, etc.
      * privacy using semantic types results in accurate reachability for `impl Trait`, which fixes #35870, and thorough introspection of associated types, which may allow relaxing private-in-public checking on bounds, while keeping the intended ban on projections with private type parameters
