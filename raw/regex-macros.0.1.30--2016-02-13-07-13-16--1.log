    Auto merge of #31570 - tomaka:ignore-emscripten, r=brson
    
    Ignores 82 rpass tests that use threads.
    I took care to only ignore tests that call `thread::spawn`. Some tests, for example `issue-16597`, also do fail because of lack of threads support, but for other reasons.
    
    With this PR, we're down to 49 failures.
